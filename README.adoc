= DIY Oil and Filter Service on 722.9 and 722.9 Plus (A89) Transmissions - Parts Selection

====
Please note that this is a guide based on my own research and experience as a DIYer, do not take the following as absolute facts, and verify on your own.
====

=== Latest Version
This guide will be kept up to date on https://github.com/PetterVennberg/722.9-oil-change/tree/main[Github], based on any feedback.

== TL;DR
[NOTE]
====
* **Fluid - Color must be verified**  
** 722.9 uses MB 236.14
*** Color: Red
*** Aproximately 2003 to mid-2010.
** 722.9 Plus uses: MB 236.15
*** Color: Blue, green, or blue/green.
*** Aproximately mid-2010 to 2016.
* **Quantity (with safety margins)**  
** 8 Liters (pan only)  
** 12 Liters (including torque converter)  
* **Pan Version**  
** V2 (early):  
*** Filter: A 221 277 01 98  
*** Overflow tube, white: A 251 271 00 97
** V3 (late):
*** Filter: A 222 277 28 00
*** Overflow tube, green: A 222 271 00 97
* **Upgrade**  
** Consider replacing old-style pans with V3; follow the Version 3 parts list and add the v3 pan (A 222 270 05 12).  
* **Before ordering parts**
** Inspect your pan in-person, verify the version used. Verify the tube, filter, and drain plugs (pan and torque converter) if possible.  
* **Addition to johnand's guide**
** Lubricate the pan gasket on both sides (pan, and transmission side) with a little transmission oil to reduce the likelyhood of leaks.  
====

== Parts Selection
There are two things you have to make sure of before ordering the parts needed.

. What type of oil your transmission uses.
. What oil pan you have on your transmission.  


=== Oil Type and Quantity
==== Oil Type
** 722.9 uses MB 236.14
*** Color: Red
*** Aproximately 2003 to mid-2010.
** 722.9 Plus uses: MB 236.15
*** Color: Blue, green, or blue/green. I have come across different colors for oil with this spec.
*** Aproximately mid-2010 to 2016.

**There are three ways I would advise you to find out what oil you need:**

* By year:
** Cars pre 2010 are almost garantueed to use MB 236.14 (red)
** Cars post 2010 are almost garantueed to use MB 236.15 (blue)
** Depending on your situation this might suffice as verification.
* Drain a few drops of oil from your transmission to find out if its red or blue.
** Might be hard to see if the oil is very old.
* Ask a Mercedes dealer to check what oil is right for your transmission.
** I have experienced situations where independent parts suppliers has recommended the wrong oil and would not trust that they are correct.
* Use a VIN decoder to find out if your car has the A89 option.

==== Oil Quantity
To make sure you don't run out of oil during the procedure you should get enough to be on the safe side:

* 8 liters if only draining the pan.
* 12 liters if draining the torque converter.

=== Oil Pan 
What oil pan version you have dictates what filter and overflow tube you need.  

There are three different oil pans that has been used on the 722.9 through out the years. On some cars the pan might have been replaced during a previous service as part of an upgrade, meaning that the filter and overflow tube suggested by Mercedes and other part suppliers might not fit your transmission even if the VIN number is used to find parts.  

**Oil Pan Versions:**  

[NOTE]
====
The use of version 1 through 3 is my own nomenclature, not Mercedes Benz designations.

You can reference https://youtu.be/Or9OImaE0UI?si=S5CCRV_WvB9OqrB6[this video by Mercedessource] in order to identify what pan you have.

See further details below.

== Procedures for Performing Service
https://mbworld.org/forums/c-class-w203/365242-diy-722-9-7g-tronic-7-speed-automatic-transmission-service-thread.html[See the post and related documents that johnand has compiled.] This is a good guide for performing the actual service.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FPFR4xUCB0[The video by Geoff Pegg] is also a very good resource.

== Closing Thoughts and Invitation for Feedback
Thanks to johnand, 6o4o, Geoff Pegg, Mercedessource, and FCP Euro for laying the groundwork and sharing their insights. I hope this consolidated guide streamlines the 722.9 and 722.9 Plus service process for fellow DIYers.

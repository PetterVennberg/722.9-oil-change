== Introduction & Tribute
I wanted to pull together the 722.9, and 722.9 Plus service resources available online to make it easier for the DIYers to get the right parts for their car. 

Would like to give credit to the following people:

Please note that this is a guide based on my own research and experience as a DIYer, do not take the following as absolute facts, and verify on your own.

=== Latest version
This guide will be kept up to date based on feedback at https://github.com/PetterVennberg/722.9-oil-change/tree/main[Github].

== Parts Selection
There are two things you have to make sure of before ordering the parts needed.

. What type of oil your transmission uses:
.. 722.9 uses a red oil: MB 236.14, ATF 134.
.. 722.9 Plus uses a blue oil (sometimes refered to as green): MB 236.15, ATF 134 FE.
. What oil pan you have on your transmission (it's strongly advised to inspect this manually on your car).

=== Oil type and quantity
==== Oil type
There are three ways I would advise you to find out what oil you need:

* Drain a SMALL amount of oil from your transmission to find out if its red or blue.
* Ask a Mercedes dealer to check what oil is right for your transmission.
* Use a VIN decoder to find out if your car has the A89 option.

I have experienced situations where independent parts suppliers has recommended the wrong oil and would not trust that they are correct.

==== Oil quantity
To make sure you don't run out of oil during the procedure you should get enough to be on the safe side:

* 8 liters if not draining the torque converter.
* 12 liters if draining the torque converter.

=== Oil pan
What oil pan version you have dictates what filter, overflow tube, and potentially what drain plug and copper washer you need.  

There are three different oil pans that has been used on the 722.9 through out the years. On some cars the pan might have been replaced during a previous service as part of an upgrade, meaning that the filter and overflow tube suggested by Mercedes and other part suppliers might not fit your transmission even if the VIN number is used to find parts.  

==== The different oil pan versions:
You can reference https://youtu.be/Or9OImaE0UI?si=S5CCRV_WvB9OqrB6[this video by Mercedessource] in order to identify what pan you have.

https://mbworld.org/forums/c-class-w203/365242-diy-722-9-7g-tronic-7-speed-automatic-transmission-service-thread.html[See the post and related documents that johnand has compiled.] This is a good guide for performing the actual service.

== Closing Thoughts & Invitation for Feedback
Thanks to johnand, 6o4o, and Geoff Pegg for laying the groundwork and sharing their insights. I hope this consolidated guide streamlines the 722.9 and 722.9 Plus service process for fellow DIYers. Please post any questions, corrections, or alternative tips you’ve discovered.
